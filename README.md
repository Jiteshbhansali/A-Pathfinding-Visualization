# Astar-Pathfinding-Visualization
This A* Path Finding visualization will show you how to implement the a* search algorithm using pygame in python. I have build a pathfinding visualizer tool to visualize a star pathfinding algorithm as it runs. It finds the shortest distance between the start node and goal node entered by user. This astar pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is much more efficient than standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search.

Here Different colors have different meaning:

Orange represents start node, Light Blue represents goal node, the node that has been considered is represented by red color, Black color represents as barrier which is given by user and final Path is represented by Purple color
